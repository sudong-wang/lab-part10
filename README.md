# Outline

We plan to build a series of leds that is connected in parallel.

We will firstly make those leds which may contain different color light up in sequence, and design a lighting pattern such as the snake pattern similar to lab2a pattern. This is cool because it is like a gaming rgb device on my desktop.

we will then make the a light alerting clock that is designed for traffic lights. The red light will first flash with showing :"Wait", then the yellow light flash many times and stop. Finally, the blue light will flash with showing "Ready". 


# components

A couple of Leds

A couple of resistor which are 330ohm or 1kohm

A couple of connecting wire

Question:
What is the sensor return value since it is hard to make it a function without knowing the return value.

Does the gesture sensor use the clk to perform the sensing process?

How many GPIOs can we use to connect led?
